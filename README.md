# Titanic Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization

### Overview
This project involves performing data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization on the Titanic dataset. Using this classic dataset, the project aims to explore relationships between passenger features (such as age, class, and fare) and their survival outcomes.

### Project Objectives
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, drop unnecessary columns, and prepare the data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Generate insights by visualizing the distribution of features and analyzing survival rates across different passenger groups.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Visualize correlations between numerical variables to identify possible relationships with survival.
- **Insights and Findings**: Analyze patterns, such as how survival is influenced by age, gender, and passenger class.

### Key Features
- **Survival Rate Analysis by Gender and Class**: Visualizes survival rates by passenger class and gender.
- **Age Distribution**: Plots age distribution for survivors and non-survivors.
- **Correlation Heatmap**: Displays correlations among numerical variables to identify relationships with survival.
